1. Write a Python program to convert the distance (in feet) to inches, yards, and miles.
           
distanceFeet = float(input("Enter the distance in feet: "))
distanceInches = distance_feet * 12
distanceYards = distance_feet / 3
distanceMiles = distance_feet / 5280
print(f"The distance in inches is (distanceInches)")
print(f"The distance in yards is (distanceYards)")
print(f"The distance in miles is (distanceMiles)")

2. Write a Python program to check whether a number is divisible by another number. Accept two integerâ€™s values form the user.
num1 = int(input("Please enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Please enter the second number: "))
if num1 % num2 == 0:
    print(f"(num1) is divisible by (num2).")
else:
    print(f"(num1) is not divisible by (num2).")

3. Write a Python program to check whether an alphabet is a vowel or consonant.

alphabet = input("Please enter an alphabet: ")
if alphabet in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']:
    print(f"(alphabet) is a vowel.")
else:
    print(f"(alphabet) is a consonant.")



4. Write a program to print multiplication table of any given number in the format given below:
            12 x 1 = 12
            12 x 2 = 24
num = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
for i in range(1, 11):
    result = num * i
    print(f"{num} x {i} = {result}")
    
5.    Write a program to display numbers from -10 to -1.  
      for i in range(-10, 0):

6.    Calculate the cube of every number upto 20.

for i in range(1, 21):
    cube = i ** 3
    print(f"The cube of {i} is {cube}")

7.    Write a program to find the factorial of any given number. 
   num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
factorial = 1
for i in range(1, num + 1):
    factorial *= i
print(f"The factorial of {num} is {factorial}")

8.    Write a program to create a calculator and use while loop so the user can use it again without running the program.
