1. write a program to check if number is divisible by both 6 and 9. Take an input from to user for the number. 

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num % 6 == 0 and num % 9 == 0:
    print(f"(num) is divisible by both 6 and 9")
else:
    print(f"(num) is not divisible by both 6 and 9")

2. Debug the following program to check if the number is odd or even:
   num = input('enter number: ')
   if num/2 != 0:
      print("even")
   else:
      print(odd)
      
num = int(input("enter number: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("even")
else:
    print("odd")
   
3. write a program where take age as an input from the user and identify if the person is eligible to vote or not(user short hand method)

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote")


4. write a program to create area calculator
   """
   press 1 to find the area of square
   press 2 to find the area of rect
   press 3 to find the area of circle
   press 4 to find the area of triangle
   
   """
