Tasks:
1. write a program to find the area of a circle, take the input from the user for the radius.
radius = float(input('enter radius: '))
area = ((22/7)*(radius**2))
print(area)

2. Imagine you are working at a college, create a form where you ask about different details from the user in order to create their id card.
name = input("enter name:")
age = int(input("enter age: "))
gender = input("enter gender: ")
mob = int(input("enter phone number: "))

3. write a program to find the cube of 36.
print(36**3)

4. Apply all the types of Arithmetic Operators on the following Variables:
    a = 40
    b = 5
print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b)
print(a**b)
print(a%b)
print(a//b)
    
5. x = 56
   y = "44"
 write a program to display sum of both the variables. 
 and the output of the program should be 100.
 
x = 56
y = "44"
y = int(y)
print(x+y)
