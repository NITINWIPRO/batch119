Tasks:
1. write a program to find the area of a circle, take the input from the user for the radius.

radius = float(input('enter radius: '))
area = ((22/7)*(radius**2))
print(area)




2. Imagine you are working at a college, create a form where you ask about different details from the user in order to create their id card. 

name = input("enter name:")
age = int(input("enter age: "))
gender = input("enter gender: ")
year = input("enter semester: ")
ph_no = int(input("enter phone number: "))


3. write a program to find the cube of 36. 
    print(36**3)
4. Apply all the types of Arithmetic Operators on the following Variables:
    a = 40
    b = 5
    print(a+b)
    print(a-b)
    print(a*b)
    print(a/b)
    print(a**b)
    print(a%b)
    print(a//b)
5. x = 56
   y = "44"
   
   write a program to display sum of both the variables. 
   and the output of the program should be 100.
   x = 56
   y = "44"
   y = int(y)
   print(x+y)
